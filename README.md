# CPSCProject

This project was created for the final capstone class in Virginia Tech's BIT program. It was developed including a front-end using Bootstrap, VueJS, EJS, 
and a back-end using NodeJS/ExpressJS server interfacing with a MariaDB database.

Thanks to my teammates who helped out with the project. A web developer can't do much without the rest of his AGILE team.
